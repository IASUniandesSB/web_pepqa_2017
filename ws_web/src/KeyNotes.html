    <h2>Mark Halpin Ph.D.</h2>
    
    Alabama Power Company Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Auburn University, USA. Dr. S. Mark Halpin has been a driving force in the development of uniform <b>power systems and power quality standards </b> that promote worldwide reliability and safety. His work in both the IEEE Power Engineering and IEEE Industry Applications Societies resulted in the creation of nearly <b> 40 IEEE power standards </b>. Dr. Halpin, who is the Alabama Power Company Distinguished Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Auburn University in Auburn, Alabama, has made many other related contributions. These include pioneering methods for both power quality measurement and techniques to identify areas of bulk power transmission systems subject to voltage and angular stability problems. An IEEE Fellow, Dr. Halpin received the 1998 IEEE IAS Outstanding Young Member Award and an IEEE Third Millennium Medal.
